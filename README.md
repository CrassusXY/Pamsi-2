# Priority queue with simple example

## Given task
My task was to sort large list of movies - 'projekt2_dane.csv' - by thier opinion using three diffrent sorting algorithms:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bucket Sort
And test their computational complexity.

## Testing
To check if the elements were sorted correctly, I used the function `sorted`. 
In addition to test computational complexity, I conducted tests of the execution time of the operation depending on the number of elements on list.
All results are shown in `PAMSI_2.pdf`.

## Running the program
After cloning the repository simply run ` make ` command. Later you can run the program using `./rank.out'.
